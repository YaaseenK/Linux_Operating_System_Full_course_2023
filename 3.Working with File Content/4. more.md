## more
**more** command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying one screen at a time in case the file is large (For example log files). The more command also allows the user do scroll up and down through the page. The syntax along with options and command is as follows. Another application of more is to use it with some other command after a [pipe](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/). When the output is large, we can use more command to see output one by one.

`more [FILENAME]...`

````
`**more [-options] [-num] [+/pattern] [+linenum] [file_name]**`

- **[-options]**: any option that you want to use in order to change the way the file is displayed. Choose any one from the followings: (-d, -l, -f, -p, -c, -s, -u)
- **[-num]**: type the number of lines that you want to display per screen.
- **[+/pattern]**: replace the pattern with any string that you want to find in the text file.
- **[+linenum]**: use the line number from where you want to start displaying the text content.
- **[file_name]**: name of the file containing the text that you want to display on the screen.

## less

Less is a command line utility that displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time. It is similar to `more`, but has more advanced features and allows you to navigate both forward and backward through the file.

When starting `less` doesn’t read the entire file which results in much faster load times compared to text editors like `vim` or [`nano`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/) .

The `less` command is mostly used for opening [large files](https://linuxize.com/post/find-large-files-in-linux/) .

`less [OPTIONS] filename`
