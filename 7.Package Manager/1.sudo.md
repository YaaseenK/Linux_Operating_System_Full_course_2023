The sudo command in Linux allows superusers to execute commands with elevated privileges, similar to Windows' "run as administrator." To use this command, the user must have an entry in the sudoers file at "/etc/sudoers". To edit or view the file, use the sudo command.


By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password that is the user’s password, not the root password itself.

# ## **The syntax for `sudo` command:**
```
**sudo** **-V | -h | -l | -v | -k | -K | -s | [ -H ] [-P ] [-S ] [ -b ] |**

```
