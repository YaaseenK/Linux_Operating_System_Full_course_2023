Just as it sounds, the `uptime` command is used to display how long the system has been running or has remained active. This command retrieves the following information:

- The current time of the computer in the format of hh:mm:ss
- The total time that the system has been up, displayed in days, hours, and/or minutes as appropriate
- The number of users who are active, and who are logged into the system
- The average system load during the last one, five, and fifteen-minute durations. This metric shows the demand for a server’s CPU and the average number of processes that are:
    - Currently using the CPU
    - Waiting to use the CPU
    - Waiting for IO or disk access

You can invoke the `uptime` command using the following syntax:
`uptime`

For example, running the `uptime` command on a Linux system will display an output similar to:
`20:11:37 up 172 days, 22 min, 4 users, load average: 0.23, 0.54, 0.31`
