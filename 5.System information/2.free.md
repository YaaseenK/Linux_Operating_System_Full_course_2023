LINUX provides a command line utility called "free command" to display the total free memory, free space, and system usage, along with the amount of swap memory and kernel buffers, for easy application installation.

This is pretty much what free command does for you.  
**Syntax:**
```
$free [OPTION]

**OPTION :** refers to the options 
compatible with free command.
```

As free displays the details of the memory related to your system , its syntax doesnâ€™t need any arguments to be passed but only options which you can use according to your wish.
