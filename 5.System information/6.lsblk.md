list block devices 
**Lsblk** is used to display details about block devices and these block devices(Except ram disk) are basically those files that represent devices connected to the pc. It queries **/sys** virtual file system and **udev db** to obtain information that it displays. And it basically displays output in a tree-like structure. This command comes pre-installed with the util-Linux package.
