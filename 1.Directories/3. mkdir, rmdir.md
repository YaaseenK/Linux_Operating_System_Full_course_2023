The mkdir command is a powerful tool in operating systems that enables users to create directories, set permissions, and manage multiple directories simultaneously, ensuring proper permissions.

``mkdir [options...] [directories ...]``
``mkdir [directory name]``
Example
``mkdir Test``

``**mkdir -p [directories]**``
``**mkdir -p first/second/third**``
``-p`` = create multiple directories
``mkdir -p Linux/Ubuntu/river``

rmdir
The rmdir command is useful when you want to remove the empty directories from the filesystem in Linux.
``rmdir <options> <directory>``
``rmdir <directory>``

- **-p**: This option removes the directory, including all its ancestors
- You can use the -p option with the rmdir command to delete a directory, including all the subdirectories:
`rmdir -p mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/...../mydirN`
For example, we will delete the LINUX directory, including all its all ancestors, through the following command:
``rmdir -p LINUX/mydir1/mydir2/mydir3
``rmdir -p Linux/Ubuntu/River``
